        <h1>Product Privacy Statement Viren</h1>

        <h2>General information</h2>

        <p>Your privacy is important to us. </p>

        <p>This privacy statement explains what data Teal Partners BV may collect through our product called "Viren" and how we use that data ("Product Privacy Statement"). Viren is a licence based tool that provides features for service management and remote collaboration. </p>

        <p>Teal Partners is a private limited liability company incorporated under Belgian law, having its offices at Damplein 23, 2060 Belgium, and registered with the Crossroads Bank for Enterprises under number 0642.824.542 ("Teal Partners", "we", "our", "us").</p>

        <p>This Product Privacy Statement can be modified, e.g. as a result of new functionalities of Viren. We thus advise you to check this Product Privacy Statement regularly. </p>

        <h2>When does this Product Privacy Statement apply?</h2>

        <p>This Product Privacy Statement applies to processing of personal data through Viren.</p>

        <p>This Product Privacy Statement does not apply to other processing activities by Teal Partners which are not related to Viren. In such cases the general Privacy Policy available on our website will apply.</p>

        <h2>Who is responsible for the processing of your personal data?</h2>

        <p>Viren is intended for use by organizations ("end users") and is administered and controlled by these end users. </p>

        <p>When your organization, as an end user, is using Viren, your organization is responsible for the processing of these data through Viren and is hence the data controller. This means that your organization determines for what purposes and with what means the data are processed. If you as a data subject wish to exercise your rights as described under the last section of this Product Privacy Statement, you will have to address the end user in the first place. In this case Teal Partners will not have the right to directly assist you.</p>

        <h3>Teal Partners as a processor</h3>

        <p>Teal Partners may be processing personal data on behalf of end users. In those cases Teal Partners acts as a data processor and a data processing agreement has been agreed upon. </p>

        <h3>Teal Partners as a controller</h3>

        <p>In addition to the above, Teal Partners also processes personal data on its own initiative for the purposes explained below, without receiving instructions from the end user. With regard to these processing activities, Teal Partners itself is responsible for processing, and therefore data controller next to the processing activities by the end user. Teal Partners only processes the personal data in limited cases. All these cases are explained in this Policy.</p>

        <h2>Which data may Teal Partners process about you?</h2>

        <p>The data Teal Partners collects as a data controller depend on the context of interactions with Teal Partners.</p>

        <h2>Who do we share data with?</h2>

        <p>Your personal data will be kept in Belgium, another country within the European Economic Area or a destination country which, according to the European Commission, offers an adequate level of protection.
